# Video Chat

A simple video chat between two people as an example of how to connect two browsers via WebRTC using Twilio STUN/TURN infrastracture.

This is an updated version of [this repo](https://github.com/philnash/video-chat). The update includes: 
* Replace Hapi with Express
* Remove Googleâ€™s adapter.js library in favour of standard supported features
* Add logging

# Quick start
* Clone this repo
```
https://github.com/vernig/video-chat.git
```
* Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
* Start the server
```
npm start
```
* Open two browsers on your laptop and point them `localhost:3000`. If you want to use a client on another machine, make sure to publish your server on an HTTPS connection (otherwise the camera may not work depoending on your browser). You can use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for that. 
* Click on the "Get Video" button on both browsers
* Click on button "Call" on one of the browser, to establish the video call
